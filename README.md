# hello-world

Hello all, I'm working on improving my skills with JavaScript, Angular, HTML, CSS, Java, Spring, and PHP. 
I've been away for awhile, but now I'm getting back into things super fast.  
There have been a lot of changes while I was away, and I wish I'd learned more when
I started.  But I am learning quickly.

My name is Todd, uroscion is my username for everything.
